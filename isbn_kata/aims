REQUIREMENTS FOR ISBN
# ISBN-10 is made up of 9 digits plus a check digit (which
# may be 'X') and ISBN-13 is made up of 12 digits plus a
# check digit. Spaces and hyphens may be included in a code,
# but are not significant. This means that 9780471486480 is
# equivalent to 978-0-471-48648-0 and 978 0 471 48648 0.

# The check digit for ISBN-10 is calculated by multiplying
# each digit by its position (i.e., 1 x 1st digit, 2 x 2nd
# digit, etc.), summing these products together and taking
# modulo 11 of the result (with 'X' being used if the result
# is 10).

# The check digit for ISBN-13 is calculated by multiplying
# each digit alternately by 1 or 3 (i.e., 1 x 1st digit,
# 3 x 2nd digit, 1 x 3rd digit, 3 x 4th digit, etc.), summing
# these products together, taking modulo 10 of the result
# and subtracting this value from 10, and then taking the
# modulo 10 of the result again to produce a single digit.
